Goal:
  - to create a query that does the following multi step process:
     - Maintain a list of pools (identified by their poolids).
     - Sanitize this list dynamically so as to check if pools are active or not ?
     - For each pool maintain the following parameters:
         - pool id
	 - stake address
	 - Verify for delegation we need any other address than staking address ?
	 - List: Number of delegators to that pool, Total delegated amount, epoch id, reward obtained


--------------------------------------------------------SAMPLE QUERIES TO ACHIEVE THE ABOVE GOAL---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1: GIVES ALL THE POOL PARAMETERS
select * from pool_meta_data pm left join pool_update pu on pu.meta_id=pm.id where pm.url='https://lkbh-pool.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/metadata.json'; (gives all the pool parameters)


Q2: GIVES ALL THE STATIC PARAMETERS FOR A PARTICULAR POOL ID (like amount of pledge, fixed cost and margin) 
select * from (select * from pool_update
              where registered_tx_id in (select max(registered_tx_id) from pool_update group by reward_addr_id)
              and not exists (select * from pool_retire where pool_retire.hash_id = pool_update.id))tc_1 
			  inner join pool_hash 
			  on tc_1.hash_id = pool_hash.id
			  where pool_hash.view='pool1pnsk7v8a4eyn9qtqev7k3clazzw2s66cpa850zprqlu5x5eqtuw';
