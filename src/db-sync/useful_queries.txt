Goal:
  - to create a query that does the following multi step process:
     - Maintain a list of pools (identified by their poolids).
     - Sanitize this list dynamically so as to check if pools are active or not ?
     - For each pool maintain the following parameters:
         - pool id
	 - stake address
	 - Verify for delegation we need any other address than staking address ?
	 - List: Number of delegators to that pool, Total delegated amount, epoch id, reward obtained


--------------------------------------------------------SAMPLE QUERIES TO ACHIEVE THE ABOVE GOAL---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1: GIVES ALL THE POOL PARAMETERS

select * from pool_meta_data pm left join pool_update pu on pu.meta_id=pm.id where pm.url='https://lkbh-pool.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/metadata.json'; (gives all the pool parameters)

Q2: LIST ALL THE POOL IDS (that are valid):

select view from (select * from pool_update
              where registered_tx_id in (select max(registered_tx_id) from pool_update group by reward_addr_id)
              and not exists (select * from pool_retire where pool_retire.hash_id = pool_update.id))tc_1 
			  inner join pool_hash 
			  on tc_1.hash_id = pool_hash.id;


Q3: GIVES ALL THE STATIC PARAMETERS FOR A PARTICULAR POOL ID (like amount of pledge, fixed cost and margin) 

select * from (select * from pool_update
              where registered_tx_id in (select max(registered_tx_id) from pool_update group by reward_addr_id)
              and not exists (select * from pool_retire where pool_retire.hash_id = pool_update.id))tc_1 
			  inner join pool_hash 
			  on tc_1.hash_id = pool_hash.id
			  where pool_hash.view='pool1pnsk7v8a4eyn9qtqev7k3clazzw2s66cpa850zprqlu5x5eqtuw';



Q4: CALCULATE THE REWARDS PER EPOCH FOR A PARTICULAR POOL:

select tc_1.epoch_no, sum(tc_1.ADA_rewarded) as total_epoch_reward from (select reward.epoch_no, stake_address.view as delegated_pool, reward.amount/1000000 as ADA_rewarded from reward 
				inner join stake_address on reward.addr_id = stake_address.id
        		inner join pool_hash on reward.pool_id = pool_hash.id
				where pool_hash.view ='pool14wk2m2af7y4gk5uzlsmsunn7d9ppldvcxxa5an9r5ywek8330fg' 
        		order by epoch_no asc) tc_1
			group by tc_1.epoch_no;

Q5: CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS MINTED BY A PARTICULAR POOL (INCLUDING ALL EPOCHS):

select count(*) from (select block.block_no, block.epoch_no, pool_hash.view as pool_view from block 
				inner join slot_leader on block.slot_leader_id = slot_leader.id
        		inner join pool_hash on slot_leader.pool_hash_id = pool_hash.id
        		where pool_hash.view = 'pool14wk2m2af7y4gk5uzlsmsunn7d9ppldvcxxa5an9r5ywek8330fg')ct_1;


(derivation from above to do that for a particular epoch):

select count(*) from (select block.block_no, block.epoch_no, pool_hash.view as pool_view from block 
				inner join slot_leader on block.slot_leader_id = slot_leader.id
        		inner join pool_hash on slot_leader.pool_hash_id = pool_hash.id
        		where pool_hash.view = 'pool14wk2m2af7y4gk5uzlsmsunn7d9ppldvcxxa5an9r5ywek8330fg'  and block.epoch_no=212 )ct_1;


[epoch_no  block_id] for all epochs. (CAN BE USED AS FOUNDATION TO CALCULATE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REWARD OBTAINED]
select * from (select block.epoch_no as epoch_no, block.block_no from block 
				inner join slot_leader on block.slot_leader_id = slot_leader.id
        		inner join pool_hash on slot_leader.pool_hash_id = pool_hash.id
        		where pool_hash.view = 'pool14wk2m2af7y4gk5uzlsmsunn7d9ppldvcxxa5an9r5ywek8330fg')ct_1
				order by ct_1.epoch_no;


Q5: CALCULATE THE REWARD IN ADA FOR A PARTICULAR EPOCH AND A PARTICULAR POOL (via counting ADA award per stake address)

select st.view, round(r.amount/1000000,2) as ADA_reward from stake_address st 
			inner join reward r on st.id = r.addr_id
			inner join pool_hash ph on r.pool_id= ph.id
			where ph.view='pool14wk2m2af7y4gk5uzlsmsunn7d9ppldvcxxa5an9r5ywek8330fg' and r.epoch_no=217 
			order by ADA_reward asc;

The above gives a list as follows:

stake_address                                                | ADA_reward   
-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------
stake1ux87uj5d4zl8c78u3k9aam7czq2ht2dsaky837phpz7l0kg4gfzvt  | 0.04
stake1uyrk9a6hsz4kxuj29edhnzuu62ulxvsv59dz55ct83hee8gv3ak95  | 0.07

....

Q5 A> Calculate the total reward for a pool in an epoch:

select round(sum(r.amount/1000000),2) as Total_reward from stake_address st 
			inner join reward r on st.id = r.addr_id
			inner join pool_hash ph on r.pool_id= ph.id
			where ph.view='pool14wk2m2af7y4gk5uzlsmsunn7d9ppldvcxxa5an9r5ywek8330fg' and r.epoch_no=225;


Q5 b> Calculate the total ADA delegated to a pool in an epoch:




Q5 c> Now calculate the ROI for a pool in an epoch (using a>/b>)
